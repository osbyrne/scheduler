# Task Management and Constraints Processing

In this code snippet, several functions and a class are provided to process tasks with specified constraints. Here's a breakdown of each component, along with explanations for their purpose and function:

## The `Task` Class

The `Task` class represents a task with its associated attributes like `task_id`, `duration`, `predecessors`, and `successors`. This class serves as a blueprint for creating individual tasks with their characteristics.

### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, task_id, duration, *args):
    self.task_id = task_id
    self.duration = duration
    self.predecessors = args
    self.successors = []
